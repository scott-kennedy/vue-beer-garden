A Punk API Vue app

Welcome to the Vue Beer Garden!

In this tutorial, you will begin with `git clone https://github.com/ultraJeff/vue-beer-garden.git`

Next, make sure to have node.js and npm installed. Install node.js v10.15 here: https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.0/node-v10.15.0.pkg - this should install npm at the same time. Run `node -v` an `npm -v` to see what versions you have installed.

Next install vue-cli with `npm install -g @vue/cli` and check the version with `vue -version` to make sure that it is `v3.3.0`.

Now that Vue is installed on your command line, choose one of the following options:

1. Run `vue ui`. Once the GUI loads, go to the Create tab and specify the app folder and uncheck the initiate git repository checkbox. Choose the default preset when asked.
2. `vue create vue-beer-garden` in the parent folder you want to place the app and select the default preset when prompted.
